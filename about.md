The site author participates in a traditional music session that takes place each Wednesday night at the
Raglan Road pub in Tramore, Co. Waterford, Ireland. The session's main focus is Irish traditional music but
tunes and songs from other folk genres are played too.

The focus of the site is mainly to provide a fixed web location from which the list of tunes that we play
can be found. Also, other notes about learning the music and session in general will be put up here.

The site is implemented using the static site generator [Jekyll][3] but with some client side dynamic elements
where Google's [Angular JS (1.x)][4] is is for visual pieces and [Underscore][5] is used for dynamic text
processing using its functional programming paradigm. Also, Yahoo's [Pure][1] CSS framework is used to
implement a responsive web design - site should be functional on mobile devices as well as desktop where the
layout dynamically adjusts the layout for the user device being used.

The site is deployed on [GitHub][2] as there is are no web hosting charges incurred.
